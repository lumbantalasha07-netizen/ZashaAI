# Prospeo Email Finder Integration

## Summary of Changes

Your cold outreach automation app has been successfully updated to use the Prospeo Email Finder API instead of Apify Email Search Actor.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Database Setup
- **Migrated to Supabase**: Replaced in-memory storage with persistent Supabase PostgreSQL database
- **Created `leads` table** with new columns:
  - `found_email`: Email discovered by Prospeo API
  - `email_confidence`: Confidence score from Prospeo
  - `enrichment_status`: Tracks enrichment progress (pending, enriched, failed, skipped)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp for lead creation

### 2. Prospeo Integration
- **New file**: `server/prospeo.ts` - Contains the Prospeo API integration
- **API Configuration**: Uses Prospeo's Email Finder endpoint
- **Request format**: Sends `first_name`, `last_name`, and `company_domain` to Prospeo
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handles API failures and logs detailed errors

### 3. CSV Upload Enhancement
- **Updated**: `server/routes.ts` - CSV upload endpoint now enriches emails via Prospeo
- **Testing mode**: Processes first 5 rows only (configurable)
- **Enrichment logic**:
  - If lead has no email but has `firstName` and `domain`, queries Prospeo
  - If email found, stores in `found_email` with confidence score
  - If email already exists in CSV, skips enrichment
  - Updates `enrichment_status` based on results

### 4. Test Endpoint
- **New route**: `GET /api/test-email-lookup`
- **Purpose**: Displays first 5 leads with email lookup results
- **Console output**: Prints formatted test results showing:
  - Lead name and company
  - Original email (from CSV)
  - Found email (from Prospeo)
  - Confidence score
  - Enrichment status
  - Any error messages

### 5. Environment Variables
Added to `.env`:
```
PROSPEO_API_KEY=ea5e77da7f89e845b25557093301a6b8
DATABASE_URL=https://ovrgptrpwmeeoblmhkrx.supabase.co/rest/v1/
```

## How to Test

### Step 1: Upload CSV
1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Upload your CSV file with columns: `first_name`, `last_name`, `company`, `domain`, `has_website`
3. The system will automatically:
   - Create lead records in Supabase
   - Query Prospeo for the first 5 leads without emails
   - Store found emails and confidence scores
   - Generate AI email templates

### Step 2: Check Test Results
Visit: `http://localhost:5000/api/test-email-lookup`

This will show:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalLeads": 5,
  "testResults": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "company": "Acme Corp",
      "domain": "acme.com",
      "originalEmail": "john@acme.com",
      "foundEmail": "john.doe@acme.com",
      "emailConfidence": "95",
      "enrichmentStatus": "enriched",
      "errorMessage": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: View Console Logs
Server console will display:
```
Processing first 5 leads for email enrichment
Looking up email for John Doe at acme.com
✓ Found email: john.doe@acme.com (confidence: 95)
```

## Features Preserved

All existing functionality remains intact:
- ✅ CSV upload and parsing
- ✅ AI-generated email templates (website/no-website variants)
- ✅ Sendinblue email sending integration
- ✅ Bulk email sending with throttling
- ✅ Lead management (view, edit, delete)
- ✅ Dashboard UI with stats and preview

## Testing with Sample CSV

Use the included `test_leads.csv`:
```csv
first_name,last_name,company,website,domain,has_website,profile_url,email
John,Doe,Acme Corp,https://acme.com,acme.com,true,https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe,john@acme.com
Jane,Smith,Tech Solutions,,techsolutions.com,false,https://linkedin.com/in/janesmith,jane@techsolutions.com
```

Leads with existing emails will be marked as "skipped" for enrichment.
Leads without emails will query Prospeo (limited to first 5 for testing).

## API Rate Limits

Prospeo processes only the **first 5 rows** during testing to conserve API credits. To process all leads, modify line 158 in `server/routes.ts`:

```typescript
// Change from:
const leadsToProcess = createdLeads.slice(0, 5);

// To:
const leadsToProcess = createdLeads;
```

## Error Handling

The system handles various scenarios:
- **No API key**: Returns error message
- **Missing domain**: Skips enrichment
- **API failure**: Logs error and marks lead as "failed"
- **No email found**: Marks as "failed" with error message
- **Network errors**: Catches and logs with details

## Next Steps

1. Upload test CSV to verify Prospeo integration works
2. Check `/api/test-email-lookup` endpoint for results
3. Review console logs for detailed enrichment process
4. Once verified, remove the 5-row limit to process all leads
5. Configure Sendinblue API key to enable email sending
